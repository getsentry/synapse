# Synapse

Synapse is a set of services that supports routing for the cell-based architecture at Sentry. Its primary responsibility is to ensure incoming traffic from the public internet is correctly routed to the right cell internally based on the organization routing key. Synapse ensures that the system appears as a single unified service to clients and end users â€” they are unaware of the underlying cellular model or that multiple cells exist.


### Components

Synapse consists of 3 main components:

- **Locator**:  A read-only service that maintains the mapping of organizations to cells and synchronizes data with the control plane. The locator can operate either as a standalone service that exposes a HTTP API, or as an embedded component inside the proxy layer to make in-process decisions directly. See the [locator docs](locator/README.md).

- **Proxy**: A high-performance L7 proxy that routes incoming requests to the destination service inside a cell. It uses the locator internally to dynamically resolve the cell based on the organization. The proxy supports both traditional HTTP request/response traffic and long-lived streaming connections via server sent events. See the [proxy docs](proxy/README.md).

- **Ingest Router**: A stateless, fan-out router for the `/projectconfigs` endpoint which embeds cellular information inside the project config object, enabling Relay to route ingestion traffic to the correct upstream for each project. See the [ingest-router docs](ingest-router/README.md).
