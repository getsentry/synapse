# Synapse: Proxy

### Overview
Synapse proxy is a cell-aware reverse proxy that routes incoming HTTP requests to a destination service inside a cell based on the host, URL path and organization.

### Features

- Supports traditional HTTP request/response traffic and long-lived streaming connections via server sent events
- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 for incoming and outgoing connections
- Uses the [`locator`](locator/README.md) internally to resolve organizations to cells

### Organization to cell resolution

The proxy supports two locator modes - `in_process` or `url`.
- In `url` mode, the locator is deployed separately and is called into by the proxy
- In `in_process` mode, the locator is bundled together with the proxy, and can make in-process routing decisions without the overhead of an additional HTTP call


### Deterministic route matching

Routes are matched top down in the order they are defined. For each incoming request, the proxy checks the host and path against the routeâ€™s match block, and executes the first action that matches.

**Route matching examples:**

1. Exact path match
    ```yaml
    - match:
        host: "*"       # host can be anything
        path: /health/  # only the exact path /health/ will be matched
    ```

2. Match any path
    ```yaml
    - match:
        host: de.sentry.io  # match de.sentry.io only
        path: "*"           # all paths
    ```

3. Path prefix match with dynamic segment
    ```yaml
    - match:
        host: us.sentry.io                                 # matches us.sentry.io only
        path: /organizations/{organization_id_or_slug}/*   # with {organization_id_or_slug} dynamic segment and trailing wildcard
    ```

### Route actions

Each route is associated with an action, which can be a static or dynamic routing rule.


**Route actions examples:**

1. Static proxy to an upstream
    ```yaml
    action:
        to: getsentry-de1-upstream
    ```

2. Call a function to dynamically select an upstream
    ```yaml
    action:
        resolver: resolve_cell_from_organization  # resolver function defines how a request is mapped to a cell
        default: us1                              # an optional default cell can be provider
        cell_to_upstream:                         # maps the organization's cell to a specific upstream service (e.g. getsentry, conduit, etc)
            us1: getsentry-us1-upstream
            us2: getsentry-us2-upstream
    ```


### Infrastructure endpoints

Infrastructure endpoints are exposed on a dedicated host/port in order to avoid exposure of admin endpoints to end users, and to prevent collisions with endpoints on proxied services. The host/port can be configured via the `admin_listener` block in the config file.

These include:
- `/health`
- `/ready`
