# Synapse: Proxy

### Overview
Synapse proxy is a cell-aware reverse proxy that routes incoming HTTP requests to a destination service inside a cell based on the host, URL path and organization.

### Features

- supports traditional HTTP request/response traffic and long-lived streaming connections via server sent events
- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 for incoming and outgoing connections
- Uses the [`locator`](locator/README.md) internally to resolve organizations to cells

### Organization to cell resolution

The proxy supports two locator modes - `in_process` or `url`.
- In `url` mode, the locator is deployed separately and is called into by the proxy
- In `in_process` mode, the locator is bundled together with the proxy, and can make in-process routing decisions without the overhead of an additional HTTP call


### Deterministic route matching

Routes are matched top down in the order they are defined. For each incoming request, the proxy checks the host, path and method against the routeâ€™s match block, and executes the first action that matches all three.

**Route matching examples:**

1. Exact path match
    ```yaml
    - match:
        host: "*"       # host can be anything
        path: /health/  # only the exact path /health/ will be matched
        methods: [GET]  #  only get requests will be matched
    ```

2. Match any path
    ```yaml
    - match:
        host: de.sentry.io  # match de.sentry.io only
        path: "*"           # all paths
        methods: [ALL]      # all methods
    ```

3. Path prefix match with dynamic segment
    ```yaml
    - match:
        host: us.sentry.io                                 # matches us.sentry.io only
        path: /organizations/{organization_id_or_slug}/*   # with {organization_id_or_slug} dynamic segment and trailing wildcard
        methods: [ALL]                                     # all methods
    ```

### Route actions
Each route is associated with an action -- either `handler` or `proxy`.

**Handler actions:**

A handler action returns a built-in response directly from the proxy, without forwarding the request upstream. This can be used to define infrastructure endpoints such as healthchecks and readiness probes.

**Proxy actions:**

A proxy action will proxy the request to one of the upstreams. Upstream selection can be driven by a `resolver` function.

For example, setting `resolver: resolve_cell_from_organization` together with the dynamic path `/organizations/{organization_id_or_slug}/*`, will allow the proxy to extract the organization segment, resolve the cell and route the request to the correct upstream. An optional `default` cell can be configured, which will be used if the request cannot be resolved.
